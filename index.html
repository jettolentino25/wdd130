            Hello! My name is Aaron J Evan M. Tolentino, but my friends call me Jet. I have enjoyed being a musician for
            20
            years, and I teach piano on weekends to my three craziest kids—ages 5, 8, and 10. Two of them have already
            performed in their recitals! On weekdays, I work at Chase Bank as a transaction specialist for leased cars.
            Aside from music, I enjoy volleyball in all aspects, such as playing and watching both local and
            international
            games. I hope this course will help me in my music career.
        </p>
