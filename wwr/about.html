                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The Cagayan de Oro River has long been part of local life, flowing from the mountains of Bukidnon
                    through the city and
                    into Macajalar Bay, serving communities for transport, livelihood, and recreation. While locals had
                    enjoyed floating and
                    navigating the river for years, whitewater rafting as an organized activity began in 1995 when
                    members of the Northern
                    Mindanao Mountaineering Society explored the river’s rapids for adventure. Using basic equipment and
                    guided by curiosity
                    and passion, these early pioneers discovered the river’s potential for world-class whitewater
                    experiences. In the late
                    1990s and early 2000s, rafting on the Cagayan de Oro River evolved into a formal tourism activity
                    with improved safety
                    standards, professional training, and better equipment. As interest grew, local guides and operators
                    developed
                    structured rafting routes suitable for beginners and experienced paddlers alike. Over time, the
                    river gained national
                    recognition and helped establish Cagayan de Oro as the “Whitewater Rafting Capital of the
                    Philippines,” becoming a key
                    attraction that continues to support tourism while highlighting the region’s natural beauty and
                    adventurous spirit.
